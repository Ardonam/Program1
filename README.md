The image I chose for this project is of a famous arch in Antigua Guatemala. I am half Guatemalen. My mother's family lives a short bus ride from the arch and my parents own a house only a couple blocks from where the arch stands. The arch is beautiful architecture and the valcanoes in the background make the make the pictures one of my favorite. I love the coulture of the country, and this picture seems to capture it very well.

I was unable to complete the last step of coloring the shapes acording to the pixels in the picture. I have run out of time and am turning it in as is. I have been working on this project for several weeks and have asked for help with my problem but alas here it is.
